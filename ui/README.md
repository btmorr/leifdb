# LeifDb UI

ðŸš§ **Under heavy construction -- contributions welcome!** ðŸš§

This project provides a simple front end for interacting with a LeifDb server.

When you open the app, you will land on the Admin page. This page allows you to enter the address of the HTTP interface of a LeifDb server. A card will populate with the status of the server. Once you are connected to a healthy server, you can click on the Database tab at the top to interact with it.

The dropdown menu allows you to select between "Search", "Set", and "Delete" actions. The top bar is for keys, and the lower text area is for values. Enter a key, and a value for "Set", and then click the search icon.

If you want to interact with the database separately from this UI (for instance, to test the UI), the easiest way to do that currently is to launch the server and then use the GET, PUT, and DELETE sections of the server's [Swagger page](http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html).

## Install

Ensure that `yarn` is installed, along with the most recent LTS version of Node.js. Then, in this directory run:

```
yarn
```

## Available Scripts

In this directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode--open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser

The page will reload if you make edits, and you will see any lint errors in the console

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder

<!-- notes below for once the color theme is added

The color palette was based very closely on the "Magma" colormap created by [StÃ©fan van der Walt] and [Nathaniel J. Smith] for the Python matplotlib project to ensure colorblind accessibility. Development of the exact palette used for this site was aided by [politiken-journalism/scale-color-perceptual]. For more info, check out the [colormap] page.
