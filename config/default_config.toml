# Default configuration for a 3-node cluster

# The "configuration" section is required, and must contain a "mode" field with
# values "single" or "multi"

# For single-node deployments, the configuration section should contain fields
# "host" with a string value and a "port" field with an integer value. These will
# be combined to form the NodeId for each server, which is the address for sending
# Raft RPC messages amongst the cluster.

# For multi-node deployments, the "members" field is required, and must contain
# an array of strings. All members of the cluster must receive the same
# configuration file, and each member must find an entry here for itself
# Each item in this list must have a corresponding subsection with "host"
# and "port" fields. No valid defaults/fallbacks exist.
